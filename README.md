# [JSL06] Submission: CodeCuisine Menu Display System Challenge

### Restaurant Menu System(Overview)
This project implements a simple menu system for a restaurant website. Users can view menu items categorized into starters, main courses, and desserts. They can also add items to their order, with the total order price dynamically updated.

## Menu Object
The menu object contains different categories of menu items, each represented as an array:

## Display Menu Function
The displayMenuItems(menu) function displays the menu items on the HTML page. It creates heading elements for each category and list elements for each item within the category. Additionally, it sets up an onclick event for each item to add it to the order.

## Add to Order Function
The addToOrder(itemName) function is a callback function called when an item is clicked. It adds the selected item to the order list and updates the total order price accordingly.

## Initialization
The initMenuSystem(menu) function initializes the menu system by calling the displayMenuItems(menu) function with the menu object as input.

## Getting Started
To use the menu system, simply call the initMenuSystem(menu) function with the menu object defined with your desired menu items.
Ensure that you have HTML elements with the appropriate IDs (menu, order-items, order-total) where the menu and order information will be displayed.

## Customization
You can customize the menu items and their categories by updating the menu object. Additionally, you can adjust the item prices and styling according to your preference

## Challenges
No challenges expeienced on this project. I just had to correct some spelling mistakes for my code to work.

## Feedback
Overall, I enjoyed this challenge. Looking forward to implementing these skills in other projects and learning more.
